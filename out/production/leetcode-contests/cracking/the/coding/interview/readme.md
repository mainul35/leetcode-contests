# Introduction
In most of the technology based organizations, the first defence of a recruitment process is the coding challange.
I have been currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at BRED IT, Thailand, and I am planning to chase the big
giants in technology. Therefore I will try to note down all the things I do to prepare myself for cracking the coding 
interviews.

My preferred language is Java, so whatever I will note here will either be in pseudo code or in Java.

## Basics of Programming
I will start with the very basic concept - Data types and Variable.

**Data Types:**

Before understanding data types and variables we need to understand what data is.
Basically, Data is anything that a computer can store. In fact, it is the basic 
building block of a piece of information that a computer can store.
